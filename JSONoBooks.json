      "Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom�s protective Wall. To the south, the king�s powers are failing�his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king�s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.",

So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily�s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.
